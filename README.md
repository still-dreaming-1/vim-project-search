# vim-project-search
Optimized search workflow

This grew out of my config file. I had some cool search features, but one day I found a bug in one of them that I wanted to write a test for. At that point it was easier and cleaner to turn it into a plugin than keep it in my config. I like to share my plugins.

As per what is normal for me, the main idea behind this is to create an extremely optimized workflow that allows you to do things the Vim way. So search results appear in a buffer that you can navigate around in around in the Vim way. But there are little workflow tweaks that make working with the search results very efficient. Look throught the code for more info about what features are offered. It is written to be easy to read and is well documented.

You will have to install my vim-elhiv plugin library first before this will work. Then just install this the normal way you install Vim plugins.
